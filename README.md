# MovieSelector-V1.6
Windows application that chooses a movie based on the user's mood.

My final project for Intelligent Systems class – this app is modeled after “rule-based expert systems” to select movies from an XML file based primarily on the user’s mood. It also will take into account other user selectable inputs: gender, year of release, length of movie, IMDb Rating, and whether or not it won any awards.

Instructions:
Select the two moods the best describe how you feel, then optionally select a gender and adjust the other parameters. The default settings will not take any of these parameters into account. Click the “Search for Movies” button for the results.
